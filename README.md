Original implementation of the paper **Subword-augmented Embedding for Cloze Reading Comprehension**

## Environment
MRC Model:
Python 2.7
Theano 0.9.0dev
Lasagne 0.2.dev1
BPE Segmentation:
Python 2.7 and python 3.6 would be fine :)

### Instruction 
BPE segmentation can be referred to https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt
An segmentation sample for a general use is shown in subword folder.
Firstly, learn a bpe segmentation and then use it!
build_dataset_bpe.py -> learn_bpe.py -> apply_bpe.py / word2sub.py

There are two ways of using subwords which could be adopted to various NLP tasks:
1) using the vocab->subwords mapping (as vocab_bpe_1k.txt) or
2) segment the words one by one in data processing (word2sub.py)

This implementation employs the first way. After obtaining the subword mapping file, we need to specify "subdic" directory in config.py.
